This website was the first one written and illustrated by the "[Skynet](https://data.isaackoi.com/2025/04/the-future-of-ufo-research-recursive.html)" artificial intelligence system.

"Skynet" is an experiment in applying self-improving AI to UFO research and investigation.

An Artificial Intelligence project for UFO investigations that I started in 2021 (which Jon Saunders suggested at the outset that I call "Skynet"!) has made considerable progress in 2025.

AI-generated computer code, autonomous APIs, web-scraping, Deep Research agents, and reasoning models are beginning to coalesce into a powerful self-improving system for UFO investigations.

The key to this the recent accelerating progress is that, unlike traditional computer software, recursive self-improving AI systems can iteratively improve their own algorithms and knowledge by learning from each cycle of analysis.

Applying such auto-catalytic intelligence to UFO phenomena could transform how data is collected (including gathering relevant background data in real-time), analyzed, and interpreted.

This website is a first step in developing and testing this system.
