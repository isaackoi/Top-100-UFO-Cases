As the Space Age dawned with the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik in October 1957, an equally mysterious event unfolded in the American heartland. On November 5, 1957, a Nebraska grain buyer named Reinhold O. Schmidt reported an extraordinary encounter with what he claimed was an extraterrestrial craft and its occupants. This case would become one of the more peculiar chapters in American UFO lore, evolving from a seemingly straightforward sighting report into a complex saga involving alleged repeated contacts, criminal charges, and cultural impact that continues to be discussed in UFO literature today.

## Historical Background and Key Events

### The Initial Encounter

Reinhold Oscar Albert Schmidt was born in 1897 in Kenesaw, Nebraska, and worked primarily as a grain buyer and dealer throughout his adult life[^1]. At age 60, while on a business trip to his home state representing the Val-U-Pak Company of Brawley, California, Schmidt reported a close encounter that would forever change his life.

According to Schmidt's account, on the afternoon of November 5, 1957, he was driving through a rural area near Kearney, Nebraska, when he spotted a large, cigar-shaped (or blimp-shaped) object resting in a field[^1][^6]. As he approached the object in his vehicle, his car engine reportedly stalled—a detail that paralleled other UFO reports from that period, particularly those from Levelland, Texas[^6]. Schmidt claimed that as he neared the craft on foot, two men emerged and escorted him inside the vessel[^1][^5].

Once aboard, Schmidt reported meeting a crew of four men and two women who spoke what he described as "High German" (a detail that would later take on significance)[^1]. The occupants, according to Schmidt, engaged him in conversation for approximately 30 minutes, primarily discussing the recently launched Russian Sputnik satellites and American space program efforts[^6][^11]. While initially Schmidt suggested the craft might be of terrestrial origin, possibly "a ship from another continent" operated by Russians with German scientists, the narrative would later evolve to claim the visitors were from Saturn[^6][^9].

Schmidt observed that the craft had large propellers at each end—an unusual detail for a supposed advanced spacecraft[^9]. After his brief meeting with the occupants, Schmidt left the craft, which then reportedly ascended into the air[^1].

### Immediate Aftermath and Investigation

What distinguishes Schmidt's case from many contemporary UFO reports is that he immediately contacted local authorities[^1]. Sheriff Thurston Nelson and local police officers accompanied Schmidt back to the alleged landing site, where they reportedly discovered "three sets of footprints and a mysterious green residue"[^4]. That same evening, both Schmidt and Police Chief Nelson were interviewed for local television and radio news programs[^6].

During these initial interviews, Sheriff Nelson appeared to lend some credibility to Schmidt's account, stating: "I am positive the man definitely saw the ship...definitely there were tracks there"[^6]. The sheriff described finding four leg impressions about one foot in diameter, footprints of men, and an oil-like substance that had "leaked out of the ship"[^6]. A sample of this substance—described as "a thin green oil like castor oil"—was reportedly taken for analysis, and the FBI was notified[^6].

However, the supportive stance of local authorities quickly changed. Schmidt was held overnight in jail while the investigation continued[^6]. The following day, investigators discovered that Schmidt had previously been convicted of embezzlement in 1938 and had served time in the Nebraska State Penitentiary[^1][^6]. Furthermore, during a more thorough search of the landing site, they found "an empty can of green motor oil" near the location, and similar oil was discovered in the bed of Schmidt's pickup truck[^4][^6].

On November 8, 1957, Schmidt was committed to Hastings State Hospital for psychiatric evaluation, where doctors reportedly found him to be "very ill" and "in immediate need of psychiatric treatment"[^6]. The psychiatric diagnosis labeled his UFO encounter a "hallucination," though they simultaneously considered it an attention-seeking hoax[^6].

### Air Force Response

The United States Air Force, then responsible for investigating UFO reports through Project Blue Book, took the unusual step of specifically addressing Schmidt's case in a Department of Defense press release dated November 15, 1957. Without naming Schmidt directly, they identified the Kearney, Nebraska location and stated: "Investigation revealed that local officials consider originator wholly unreliable"[^6]. This special mention was notable, as the Air Force rarely singled out individual cases for public debunking.

Schmidt remained at the state hospital for two weeks before being released on November 22, 1957. Dr. J.A. Wolford, superintendent of the facility, simply stated, "I could see no reason for keeping him longer"[^6].

### Continuing Claims and Career as a Contactee

Rather than fading into obscurity after his release, Schmidt's UFO narrative expanded dramatically. Over the next several years, he claimed multiple additional contacts with the same extraterrestrial beings[^6]. By February 1958, Schmidt had connected with Major Wayne S. Aho, a retired Army officer who had become a prominent figure in the UFO contactee movement[^6].

On February 5, 1958, Schmidt claimed a second encounter with the spaceship in Kearney, during which the occupants not only welcomed him aboard but took him on a flight[^6]. During this encounter, Schmidt claimed the entities revealed they were aware of his psychiatric detention and stated that if he had been held much longer, they "would have put on a mass demonstration over Kearney and made ourselves known"[^6]. The visitors also allegedly expressed concern about Earth's nuclear weapons[^6].

In the months that followed, Schmidt joined Aho on the UFO lecture circuit, traveling across the United States to share his experiences[^1][^9]. He published an account of his alleged encounters in a 1958 booklet titled "The Kearney Incident Up To Now: The Report of Reinhold Schmidt"[^1]. This publication was later reissued under the title "Edge of Tomorrow"[^1].

Schmidt's claims grew increasingly elaborate. By April 1958, he described being picked up by one of the visitors driving "a black MG sports car" and taken to the spacecraft[^6]. Later iterations of his story would claim the extraterrestrials kept a Volkswagen Beetle in their spacecraft for running errands and purchasing groceries—including their favorite coffee brand, MJB[^4][^9].

As his notoriety grew, Schmidt partnered with movie producers June and Ron Ormond to create a film based on his alleged experiences[^1]. The film, also titled "Edge of Tomorrow," premiered on May 28, 1961, at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre in Los Angeles[^1]. However, the June 1961 edition of "Saucer News" described the film as a "hopelessly boring, technically inadequate, poorly photographed hodge podge of inanities"[^4].

### Fraud Conviction

Schmidt's UFO career came to an abrupt halt in 1961 when he was arrested and charged with grand theft[^1][^6]. During his lectures in Bakersfield, California, Schmidt had reportedly solicited investments from audience members—primarily elderly women—claiming that his extraterrestrial contacts had directed him to a mine containing "free energy crystals"[^1][^6]. Investigators alleged that Schmidt defrauded several women out of more than \$30,000 through this scheme[^1][^6].

During Schmidt's trial, renowned astronomer Carl Sagan was called to testify as an expert witness, explaining that Saturn could not support life as Schmidt had claimed[^1]. The prosecution also showed Schmidt's own film, "Edge of Tomorrow," to the jury[^1]. On October 26, 1961, Schmidt was convicted and later sentenced to one to ten years in prison[^1][^6].

## Credibility Assessment

### Factors Undermining Credibility

Several significant factors raise serious questions about the credibility of Schmidt's claims:

1. **Criminal History**: Schmidt's prior conviction for embezzlement in 1938 establishes a pattern of fraudulent behavior that predates his UFO claims[^1][^6]. This history gives credence to the possibility that his UFO story may have been fabricated for personal gain.
2. **Physical Evidence Problems**: The "mysterious green residue" initially reported at the landing site was later matched to motor oil found in Schmidt's pickup truck, with an empty oil can discovered nearby[^4][^6]. This strongly suggests deliberate staging of evidence.
3. **Escalating Narrative**: Schmidt's story grew increasingly elaborate and fantastic over time, a pattern often seen in fabricated accounts. The addition of elements like extraterrestrials driving MG sports cars and having a preference for MJB coffee brands stretches credibility[^4][^6].
4. **Financial Exploitation**: Schmidt quickly monetized his claims through the lecture circuit and book sales, and ultimately engaged in outright fraud by soliciting investments for nonexistent "free energy crystals"[^1][^6]. This establishes a clear financial motive for his claims.
5. **Psychiatric Evaluation**: Though diagnostic practices of the 1950s differed from modern standards, mental health professionals who examined Schmidt determined his account to be either a hallucination or a deliberate hoax[^6].

### Potentially Supportive Elements

For a balanced assessment, several elements initially seemed to lend some support to Schmidt's account:

1. **Initial Police Response**: Sheriff Nelson's early statements appeared to validate that something unusual had been found at the site, including footprints and an unidentified substance[^6]. However, this support was withdrawn following a more thorough investigation.
2. **Timing Within UFO Wave**: Schmidt's report came during a significant wave of UFO sightings in November 1957, including the well-known Levelland, Texas cases where multiple witnesses reported car engines stalling near UFOs[^6]. This timing could suggest Schmidt was either influenced by these reports or experienced something connected to the same phenomenon.
3. **Consistent Initial Narrative**: Schmidt's initial account remained relatively consistent in early tellings and included specific details that aligned with other UFO reports of the era, such as electromagnetic effects on his vehicle[^6].

## Counterarguments and Skeptical Perspectives

The Schmidt case presents several classic elements that skeptics point to when analyzing UFO contactee claims of the 1950s:

### Manufactured Evidence

The discovery of the green motor oil can near the landing site, matching the substance found in Schmidt's truck, provides compelling evidence of deliberate staging[^4][^6]. This physical evidence strongly suggests Schmidt manufactured the scene to support his narrative.

### Psychological Factors

Psychiatrists who examined Schmidt concluded he was either experiencing hallucinatory episodes or engaging in deliberate deception[^6]. While diagnostic approaches have evolved since the 1950s, this professional assessment cannot be dismissed, particularly given Schmidt's later fraudulent activities.

### Cultural Context and Influence

Schmidt's account emerged during a period of intense public interest in both UFOs and the space race, immediately following the Soviet launch of Sputnik[^6]. His initial suggestion that the craft might be of Russian origin with German scientists aboard reflects the geopolitical anxieties of the Cold War era. The cultural zeitgeist provided both inspiration and a receptive audience for such claims.

### Pattern of Contactee Claims

Schmidt's evolving narrative followed a pattern common to other contactee claims of the 1950s, including those of George Adamski[^9]. These typically involved:

- Initial simple encounter
- Repeated contacts
- Increasingly elaborate journeys
- Philosophical or spiritual messages
- Warnings about Earth's destructive path
- Claims of visits to other planets or locations

This formulaic progression suggests influence from other contactee literature rather than genuine experience.


![The Reinhold Schmidt UFO Encounter (1957): A Critical Analysis - P1]({{ "/assets/images/UFO - Top 100/Reinhold Schmidt encounter 1957-P1.svg" | relative_url }})
### Financial Motivation

Schmidt's quick transition to the lecture circuit with established UFO personalities like Wayne Aho and John Otto demonstrates a clear financial incentive[^6]. His eventual conviction for defrauding elderly women through claims about "free energy crystals" identified by his space contacts confirms that monetary gain was a significant motivator[^1][^6].

## Influence and Impact

Despite its problematic credibility, the Schmidt case had notable impacts on UFO discourse and culture:

### Contribution to Contactee Movement

Schmidt became part of the burgeoning UFO contactee movement of the late 1950s, joining figures like Wayne Aho and John Otto on the lecture circuit[^1][^6]. His claims contributed to the cultural phenomenon of alleged ongoing contact with benevolent space beings that characterized this distinct branch of UFO culture.

### Media Presence

Schmidt's story received significant media attention, including local television and radio coverage immediately after the event, and later through his book and film[^1][^4][^6]. The case was reported in wire service stories (AP and UP) that reached newspapers nationwide[^6].

### International Reach

Schmidt's account extended beyond American borders when his booklet was translated and published in Germany as "Zwischenfall in Kearney" by Karl Veit, president of Deutsche UFO/IFO-Studiengemeinschaft (DUIST)[^6]. In October 1960, Schmidt was an honored guest at the International UFO Congress in Wiesbaden, Germany, where he addressed an audience of approximately 1,000 people[^6].

### Scientific Response

The case prompted direct scientific engagement when astronomer Carl Sagan testified at Schmidt's fraud trial in 1961[^1]. This represents an early example of the scientific community directly addressing UFO claims in a legal context.

### Law Enforcement and Official Response

The Schmidt case is notable for the involvement of multiple levels of authority, including:

- Local police initially investigating and appearing to support aspects of the claim
- Psychiatric professionals evaluating Schmidt
- The FBI being notified about the incident
- The Air Force specifically addressing and dismissing the case in an official statement[^6]


### Cautionary Example

Perhaps most significantly, the Schmidt case—with its progression from UFO report to fraud conviction—became a cautionary example used by skeptics to illustrate how UFO claims can be exploited for financial gain. The case demonstrated the potential for deception in the contactee movement and provided ammunition for those seeking to discredit UFO reports more broadly.

## Primary Sources and Research Materials

### Key Primary Documents

1. **Schmidt's Original Account**: "The Kearney Incident Up To Now: The Report of Reinhold Schmidt" (1958)[^1][^12]
2. **Film Documentation**: "Edge of Tomorrow" (1961), produced by Ron and June Ormond[^1]
3. **Television and Radio Interviews**: Local media coverage from November 1957, including interviews with both Schmidt and Police Chief Nelson[^6]
4. **WKY-TV Interview**: A rare surviving video clip from April 9, 1958, showing Schmidt being interviewed by newsman Ernie Schultz in Oklahoma City[^6]
5. **Project Blue Book Files**: Official Air Force documentation addressing the Schmidt case[^6]
6. **Court Records**: Transcripts from Schmidt's 1961 fraud trial, including Carl Sagan's expert testimony[^1]

### Expert Opinions and Analyses

1. **Psychiatric Evaluation**: The assessments from doctors at Hastings State Hospital, though reflecting the diagnostic standards of the time[^6]
2. **Air Force Assessment**: The official USAF position dismissing Schmidt's claims as unreliable[^6]
3. **Carl Sagan's Testimony**: Scientific perspective on the impossibility of Saturn harboring human-like life[^1]
4. **Contemporary Saucer Publications**: Critical reviews such as those in "Saucer News" provide period perspectives from within the UFO community[^4]

## Gaps in Evidence and Avenues for Further Research

Despite the extensive documentation of Schmidt's claims and subsequent legal troubles, several areas remain worthy of further investigation:

1. **Complete Medical Records**: A more thorough review of Schmidt's psychiatric evaluation might provide additional insights into his mental state and the basis for the doctors' conclusions.
2. **FBI Involvement**: The search results mention that the FBI was notified about the incident[^6]. Any FBI files on the case might contain additional investigative details not preserved elsewhere.
3. **Laboratory Analysis**: Reports indicate that samples of the green substance were collected for analysis[^6]. Records of any formal laboratory testing might exist in police archives.
4. **Court Transcripts**: A complete review of the transcripts from Schmidt's 1961 fraud trial, particularly Carl Sagan's full testimony (which he later discussed in his book "Intelligent Life in the Universe" under a pseudonym for Schmidt)[^1], could provide valuable scientific perspective.
5. **Comparative Analysis**: A systematic comparison between Schmidt's evolving narrative and other contactee claims of the same period could reveal patterns of mutual influence or inspiration.
6. **Media Archives**: A more comprehensive collection of contemporary news reports, particularly from Nebraska local media, might offer additional details about the investigation and community response.

## Conclusion

The Reinhold Schmidt UFO encounter of 1957 represents a complex case that evolved from a seemingly straightforward sighting report into a years-long saga of increasingly fantastic claims, culminating in criminal fraud. The initial investigation by local authorities, which briefly appeared to lend credibility to Schmidt's account, quickly uncovered evidence of deception that undermined his narrative.

The subsequent trajectory of Schmidt's story—with its elaborating details, immediate monetization through lectures, and eventual exploitation for outright fraud—follows patterns familiar to researchers of the contactee movement of the 1950s. His case illustrates the complex interplay between UFO reports, media coverage, cultural context, and personal motivation that characterized this era of American UFO history.

While skeptical explanations appear most consistent with the available evidence—particularly in light of Schmidt's criminal history and the discovery of staged physical evidence—the case nonetheless maintains historical significance for understanding the development and cultural impact of UFO contactee claims in the early Space Age. The Schmidt case demonstrates how UFO narratives could evolve from simple encounter reports into complex sagas that reflected the anxieties, aspirations, and imagination of mid-20th century America.
